In this exercise, we will compare the implementation of Pandas and SQL for data queries. We'll explore how to use Pandas in a manner similar to SQL by translating SQL queries into Pandas operations. It's important to note that there are various ways to achieve similar results, and the translation of SQL queries to Pandas will be done by employing some of its core methods.

We'll dive into the **nycflights13** dataset, which contains comprehensive data on `airlines`, `airports`, `weather conditions` and `aircraft` for all flights passing through New York airports in 2013. Through this exercise, we'll not only explore Pandas functionality but also learn to apply fundamental SQL concepts in a Python data manipulation environment. This comparison serves as an initial step to delve into translating SQL queries to Pandas, utilizing the available tools in this versatile and powerful library.
